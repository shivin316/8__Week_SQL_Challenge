#### 1. Join All The Things


```sql
SELECT s.customer_id,s.order_date,m.product_name,m.price,
CASE WHEN s.order_date>=ms.join_date THEN 'Y' ELSE 'N' END as 'member'
FROM members ms RIGHT JOIN sales s ON ms.customer_id=s.customer_id
INNER JOIN  menu m ON s.product_id=m.product_id
ORDER BY 1,2,3;
```

#### 2. Danny also requires further information about the ranking of customer products, but he purposely does not need the ranking for non-member purchases so he expects null ranking values for the records when customers are not yet part of the loyalty program


```sql
WITH cte as (
SELECT s.customer_id,s.order_date,m.product_name,m.price,
CASE WHEN s.order_date>=ms.join_date THEN 'Y' ELSE 'N' END as 'member',
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY s.customer_id,s.order_date,m.product_name) AS 'rn'
FROM members ms RIGHT JOIN sales s ON ms.customer_id=s.customer_id
INNER JOIN  menu m ON s.product_id=m.product_id
)
,
cte1 as (SELECT *,
DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date) AS 'ranking'
FROM cte WHERE member='Y')

SELECT cte.customer_id,cte.order_date,cte.product_name,cte.price,cte.member,cte1.ranking 
FROM cte LEFT JOIN cte1 on cte.customer_id=cte1.customer_id AND cte.rn=cte1.rn;
```
