FROM
sales
),
cte1 AS (
SELECT
member_status,COUNT(*) AS number_of_transactions FROM cte GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT member_status, number_of_transactions,
ROUND((100 * number_of_transactions::NUMERIC / SUM(number_of_transactions) OVER ()), 1) AS transaction_percentage
FROM cte1 ORDER BY 2 DESC;

CASE WHEN member iS True THEN 'Member' ELSE 'Non-member' END AS member_status
FROM
sales
),
cte1 AS (
