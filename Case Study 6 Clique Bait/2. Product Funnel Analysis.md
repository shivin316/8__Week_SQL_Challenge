### Using a single SQL query - create a new output table which has the following details:

- How many times was each product viewed?
  
- How many times was each product added to cart?

- How many times was each product added to a cart but not purchased (abandoned)?

- How many times was each product purchased?

```sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE new_product_table AS (
WITH product_view AS (
SELECT e.page_id,ph.page_name AS product ,COUNT(e.page_id) AS number_of_views
FROM events e JOIN page_hierarchy AS ph ON e.page_id = ph.page_id
WHERE e.event_type = 1 AND ph.product_category IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 1
),
cart_added AS (
SELECT e.visit_id,e.page_id,ph.page_name AS product, COUNT(visit_id)OVER(PARTITION BY e.page_id,ph.page_name) AS added_to_cart
FROM events e JOIN page_hierarchy ph ON e.page_id=ph.page_id 
WHERE e.event_type = 2 AND product_category IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 2
),
non_purchase_event AS (
SELECT DISTINCT visit_id FROM events
EXCEPT 
SELECT DISTINCT visit_id FROM events
WHERE event_type=3)
,
abandoned_count AS (
SELECT c.page_id,c.product,COUNT(c.visit_id) AS abandon_num
FROM cart_added c JOIN non_purchase_event np ON c.visit_id=np.visit_id
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 1
),
purchases AS (
SELECT visit_id FROM events WHERE event_type = 3
),
purchase_count AS (
SELECT ph.page_id,ph.page_name AS product,
COUNT(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 2 THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS purchased_count
FROM page_hierarchy  ph JOIN events e ON e.page_id = ph.page_id
JOIN purchases  p ON e.visit_id = p.visit_id
WHERE ph.product_category IS NOT NULL
AND ph.page_name NOT in('1', '2', '12', '13')
AND p.visit_id = e.visit_id
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 1)

SELECT DISTINCT v.page_id,v.product,v.number_of_views,c.added_to_cart,a.abandon_num,pc.purchased_count
FROM product_view v
JOIN cart_added c ON v.product=c.product
JOIN abandoned_count a ON c.product=a.product
JOIN purchase_count pc ON a.product=pc.product
ORDER BY 1,2);

SELECT * FROM new_product_table;
```

### Additionally, create another table which further aggregates the data for the above points but this time for each product category instead of individual products.
```sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE new_product_category_table AS (
WITH product_category_view AS (
SELECT ph.product_category ,COUNT(e.page_id) AS number_of_views
FROM events e JOIN page_hierarchy AS ph ON e.page_id = ph.page_id
WHERE e.event_type = 1 AND ph.product_category IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
),
cart_added AS (
SELECT e.visit_id,ph.product_category ,COUNT(visit_id)OVER(PARTITION BY ph.product_category) AS added_to_cart
FROM events e JOIN page_hierarchy ph ON e.page_id=ph.page_id 
WHERE e.event_type = 2 AND product_category IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 2
),
non_purchase_event AS (
SELECT DISTINCT visit_id FROM events
EXCEPT 
SELECT DISTINCT visit_id FROM events
WHERE event_type=3)
,
abandoned_count AS (
SELECT c.product_category,COUNT(c.visit_id) AS abandon_num
FROM cart_added c JOIN non_purchase_event np ON c.visit_id=np.visit_id
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
)	
,
purchases AS (
SELECT visit_id FROM events WHERE event_type = 3
),
purchase_count AS (
SELECT ph.product_category,
COUNT(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 2 THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS purchased_count
FROM page_hierarchy ph JOIN events e ON e.page_id = ph.page_id
JOIN purchases  p ON e.visit_id = p.visit_id
WHERE ph.product_category IS NOT NULL
AND ph.page_name NOT in('1', '2', '12', '13')
AND p.visit_id = e.visit_id
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1)

SELECT DISTINCT v.product_category,v.number_of_views,c.added_to_cart,a.abandon_num,pc.purchased_count
FROM product_category_view v
JOIN cart_added c ON v.product_category=c.product_category
JOIN abandoned_count a ON c.product_category=a.product_category
JOIN purchase_count pc ON a.product_category=pc.product_category
ORDER BY 1);

SELECT * FROM new_product_category_table;
```

### Use your 2 new output tables - answer the following questions:

#### 1. Which product had the most views, cart adds and purchases?
```sql
WITH cte AS (
SELECT *,DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY number_of_views DESC ) AS rk1,
DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY added_to_cart DESC ) AS rk2,
DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY abandon_num DESC ) AS rk3,
DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY purchased_count DESC ) AS rk4
FROM new_product_table)

SELECT cte.product AS most_viewed, cte1.product AS most_added_to_cart,cte2.product AS most_purchased
FROM cte 
JOIN cte cte1 ON cte.rk1 = cte1.rk2
JOIN cte cte2 ON cte1.rk2=cte2.rk4
WHERE cte.rk1=1;
```

#### 2. Which product was most likely to be abandoned?
```sql
SELECT product AS most_likely_to_abandon FROM
(SELECT * ,DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY abandon_num DESC ) AS rk 
FROM new_product_table )x WHERE rk=1;
```

#### 3. Which product had the highest view to purchase percentage?
```sql
SELECT product,view_to_purchase_pct FROM
(SELECT *,ROUND(100*(purchased_count/number_of_views ::NUMERIC),2) AS view_to_purchase_pct,
DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY ROUND(100*(purchased_count/number_of_views ::NUMERIC),2) DESC ) AS rk 
FROM new_product_table)x WHERE rk=1;
```

#### 4. What is the average conversion rate from view to cart add?
```sql 
SELECT ROUND(AVG(100 *added_to_cart/number_of_views ::NUMERIC), 2) AS view_to_cart_add_percentage
FROM new_product_table;
```

#### 5. What is the average conversion rate from cart add to purchase?
```sql
SELECT ROUND(AVG(100 * purchased_count/added_to_cart ::NUMERIC), 2) AS cart_to_purchase_percentage
FROM new_product_table;
```
