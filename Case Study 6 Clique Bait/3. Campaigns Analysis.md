### Generate a table that has 1 single row for every unique visit_id record and has the following columns
- user_id
  
- visit_id
  
- visit_start_time: the earliest event_time for each visit
  
- page_views: count of page views for each visit
  
- cart_adds: count of product cart add events for each visit
  
- purchase: 1/0 flag if a purchase event exists for each visit
  
- campaign_name: map the visit to a campaign if the visit_start_time falls between the start_date and end_date
  
- impression: count of ad impressions for each visit
  
- click: count of ad clicks for each visit
  
- (Optional column) cart_products: a comma separated text value with products added to the cart sorted by the order they were added to the cart (hint: use the sequence_number)

```sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE campaign_analysis AS (
WITH cte AS (
SELECT u.user_id,e.visit_id,MIN(start_date) AS visit_start_time,
COUNT(DISTINCT e.page_id) AS page_views,
COUNT(CASE WHEN e.event_type =2 THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS cart_adds,
COUNT(CASE WHEN e.event_type =4 THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS impression,
COUNT(CASE WHEN e.event_type=5 THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS click
FROM users u JOIN events e ON u.cookie_id=e.cookie_id
GROUP BY 1,2)
,
purchases AS (
SELECT DISTINCT visit_id FROM events WHERE event_type = 3)
,
if_purchased AS (
SELECT *,CASE WHEN visit_id IN (SELECT visit_id FROM purchases) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS purchase
FROM cte)
,
campaign AS (
SELECT ifp.*,c.campaign_name FROM if_purchased ifp
LEFT JOIN campaign_identifier c
ON ifp.visit_start_time BETWEEN c.start_date AND c.end_date )
,
product AS (
SELECT e.visit_id,STRING_AGG( ph.page_name, ', ' ORDER BY e.sequence_number) AS products
FROM events e  JOIN page_hierarchy ph
ON e.page_id = ph.page_id
WHERE ph.product_category IS NOT NULL
AND e.event_type=2
GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT c.user_id,c.visit_id,c.visit_start_time,c.page_views,c.cart_adds,c.purchase,c.campaign_name,c.impression,c.click,p.products
FROM campaign c
JOIN product p ON c.visit_id = p.visit_id);

SELECT * FROM campaign_analysis;
```

### Use the subsequent dataset to generate at least 5 insights for the Clique Bait team - bonus: prepare a single A4 infographic that the team can use for their management reporting sessions, be sure to emphasise the most important points from your findings. Some ideas you might want to investigate further include:

#### 1. Identifying users who have received impressions during each campaign period and comparing each metric with other users who did not have an impression event
```sql
WITH impressions  AS (
SELECT CASE WHEN impression= 1 THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END AS impressions, COUNT(*) AS number_of_visits,
ROUND(AVG(page_views)) AS avg_page_views,
ROUND(AVG(cart_adds)) AS avg_cart_adds, SUM(purchase) AS total_purchase
FROM campaign_analysis
GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT impressions,number_of_visits,avg_page_views,avg_cart_adds,
ROUND((100 * total_purchase / number_of_visits::NUMERIC), 1) AS purchase_pct
FROM impressions
ORDER BY 2;
```

#### 2. Does clicking on an impression lead to higher purchase rates?
```sql
WITH impressions  AS (
SELECT CASE WHEN impression= 1 THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END AS impressions, COUNT(*) AS number_of_visits,
ROUND(AVG(page_views)) AS avg_page_views,
ROUND(AVG(cart_adds)) AS avg_cart_adds, SUM(purchase) AS total_purchase
FROM campaign_analysis
GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT impressions,ROUND((100 * total_purchase / number_of_visits::NUMERIC), 1) AS purchase_pct
FROM impressions
ORDER BY 2;
```

#### 3. What is the uplift in purchase rate when comparing users who click on a campaign impression versus users who do not receive an impression? What if we compare them with users who just an impression but do not click?
```sql
WITH clicks  AS (
SELECT CASE WHEN click= 1 THEN 'ad_is_clicked' 
WHEN click = 0 AND impression =1 THEN 'watched_the_ad'
WHEN impression=0 THEN 'No_ads' ELSE NULL END AS clicks, COUNT(*) AS number_of_visits,
ROUND(AVG(page_views)) AS avg_page_views,
ROUND(AVG(cart_adds)) AS avg_cart_adds, SUM(purchase) AS total_purchase
FROM campaign_analysis
WHERE campaign_name IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT clicks,number_of_visits,avg_page_views,avg_cart_adds,
ROUND((100 * total_purchase / number_of_visits::NUMERIC), 1) AS purchase_pct
FROM clicks
ORDER BY 2;
```

#### 4. What metrics can you use to quantify the success or failure of each campaign compared to eachother?
```sql
WITH metrics AS (
SELECT CASE WHEN campaign_name IS NULL THEN 'No Campaign' ELSE campaign_name END AS campaigns,
COUNT(*) AS number_of_visits,SUM(purchase) AS total_purchase,
ROUND(AVG(page_views)) AS avg_page_views,
ROUND(AVG(cart_adds)) AS avg_cart_adds
FROM campaign_analysis
GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT campaigns,number_of_visits,avg_page_views,avg_cart_adds,
ROUND((100 * total_purchase / number_of_visits::NUMERIC), 1) AS purchase_pct
FROM
metrics;
```
