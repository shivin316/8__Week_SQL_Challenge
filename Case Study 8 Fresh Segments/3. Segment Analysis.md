#### 1. Using our filtered dataset by removing the interests with less than 6 months worth of data, which are the top 10 and bottom 10 interests which have the largest composition values in any month_year? Only use the maximum composition value for each interest but you must keep the corresponding month_year
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS filtered_im;
CREATE TEMP TABLE filtered_im AS 
WITH cte AS (
SELECT interest_id,COUNT(DISTINCT month_year) AS total_months FROM interest_metrics
WHERE month_year IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT month_year)>=6
)
SELECT *
FROM interest_metrics
WHERE interest_id  IN 
( SELECT DISTINCT interest_id FROM cte
);
```
**NOT ALL ROWS ARE DISPLAYED**

```sql
SELECT im.month_year,im.interest_id,mp.interest_name,MAX(im.composition) AS top_10_composition
FROM filtered_im im JOIN interest_map mp ON im.interest_id::INTEGER=mp.id
GROUP BY 1,2,3 ORDER BY 4 DESC LIMIT 10;
```

```sql
SELECT im.month_year,im.interest_id,mp.interest_name,MIN(im.composition) AS bottom_10_composition
FROM filtered_im im JOIN interest_map mp ON im.interest_id::INTEGER=mp.id
GROUP BY 1,2,3 ORDER BY 4 ASC LIMIT 10;
```

#### 2. Which 5 interests had the lowest average ranking value?
```sql
SELECT im.interest_id,mp.interest_name,ROUND(avg(im.ranking),2) AS avg_ranking 
FROM filtered_im im JOIN interest_map mp ON im.interest_id::INTEGER=mp.id
GROUP  BY 1,2
ORDER BY 3 DESC LIMIT 5;
```
 **In ranking numerically lower value means better ranking and larger value means low ranking hence i used ORDER BY DESC**

#### 3. Which 5 interests had the largest standard deviation in their percentile_ranking value?
 ```sql
WITH cte AS (
SELECT im.interest_id,mp.interest_name,ROUND(STDDEV(im.percentile_ranking)::numeric, 2) AS std_dev,
DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY STDDEV(im.percentile_ranking) DESC) AS rk
FROM filtered_im im JOIN interest_map mp ON im.interest_id::INTEGER=mp.id
GROUP  BY 1,2
)
SELECT *FROM cte WHERE rk <= 5;
```

#### 4. For the 5 interests found in the previous question - what was minimum and maximum percentile_ranking values for each interest and its corresponding year_month value? Can you describe what is happening for these 5 interests?
```sql
WITH cte AS (
SELECT im.interest_id,mp.interest_name,ROUND(STDDEV(im.percentile_ranking)::numeric, 2) AS std_dev,
DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY STDDEV(im.percentile_ranking) DESC) AS rk
FROM filtered_im im JOIN interest_map mp ON im.interest_id::INTEGER=mp.id
GROUP  BY 1,2
)
,
cte1 AS (
SELECT * FROM cte WHERE rk <= 5)
,
cte2 AS (
SELECT im.month_year,im.interest_id,mp.interest_name,im.percentile_ranking,
DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY im.month_year ORDER BY percentile_ranking DESC) AS maxrk ,
DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY im.month_year ORDER BY percentile_ranking) AS minrk 
FROM filtered_im im JOIN interest_map mp ON im.interest_id::INTEGER=mp.id 
WHERE im.interest_id IN (SELECT interest_id FROM cte1)
)

SELECT a.month_year,a.interest_id,a.interest_name,a.percentile_ranking AS max_pctile_rank, b.percentile_ranking AS min_pctile_rank
FROM cte2 a JOIN cte2 b ON a.month_year=b.month_year AND a.maxrk=b.minrk
WHERE a.maxrk=1 ORDER BY 1;
```

#### 5. How would you describe our customers in this segment based off their composition and ranking values? What sort of products or services should we show to these customers and what should we avoid?
```sql
SELECT im.month_year,im.interest_id,mp.interest_name,MAX(im.composition) AS top_10_composition
FROM filtered_im im JOIN interest_map mp ON im.interest_id::INTEGER=mp.id
GROUP BY 1,2,3 ORDER BY 4 DESC LIMIT 10;
```

**Based off of the highest composition values, the average customer appears to be majority work comes first travelers. products or services related to traveling should be shown to these customers**
