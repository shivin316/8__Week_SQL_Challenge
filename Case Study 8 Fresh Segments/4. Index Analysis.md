- ###  The index_value is a measure which can be used to reverse calculate the average composition for Fresh Segmentsâ€™ clients.

- ###  Average composition can be calculated by dividing the composition column by the index_value column rounded to 2 decimal places.
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS im_avg_comp;
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE im_avg_comp AS
SELECT month_year, interest_id, composition, index_value, ROUND((composition / index_value)::NUMERIC, 2) AS composition_average,ranking,
percentile_ranking
FROM interest_metrics WHERE month_year IS NOT NULL;
```

#### 1. What is the top 10 interests by the average composition for each month?
```sql
WITH cte AS (
SELECT month_year,interest_id,composition_average,
DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY month_year ORDER BY composition_average DESC) AS rk
FROM im_avg_comp
)

SELECT c.month_year,c.interest_id,mp.interest_name,c.composition_average
FROM cte c JOIN interest_map mp ON c.interest_id::INTEGER = mp.id
WHERE rk <=10 ORDER BY 1;
```
**NOT ALL ROWS ARE DISPLAYED**

#### 2. For all of these top 10 interests - which interest appears the most often?
```sql
WITH cte AS (
SELECT month_year,interest_id,composition_average,
DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY month_year ORDER BY composition_average DESC) AS rk
FROM im_avg_comp
)
,
cte1 AS (
SELECT c.month_year,c.interest_id,mp.interest_name,c.composition_average
FROM cte c JOIN interest_map mp ON c.interest_id::INTEGER = mp.id
WHERE rk <=10 ORDER BY 1)
,
cte2 AS (
SELECT interest_name,COUNT(*) AS cnt ,DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rk 
FROM cte1 GROUP BY 1)

SELECT interest_name,cnt FROM cte2 WHERE rk=1;
```

#### 3. What is the average of the average composition for the top 10 interests for each month?
 ```sql
WITH cte AS (
SELECT month_year,interest_id,composition_average,
DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY month_year ORDER BY composition_average DESC) AS rk
FROM im_avg_comp
)

SELECT month_year,ROUND(avg(composition_average),2) AS avg_of_composition_average
FROM cte WHERE rk <=10  GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1;
```

#### 4. What is the 3 month rolling average of the max average composition value from September 2018 to August 2019 and include the previous top ranking interests in the same output shown below.
```sql
WITH cte AS (
SELECT month_year,interest_id,composition_average,
DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY month_year ORDER BY composition_average DESC) AS rk
FROM im_avg_comp
),
cte1 AS (
SELECT c.month_year, mp.interest_name, c.composition_average,
ROUND((AVG(c.composition_average) OVER (ORDER BY c.month_year ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)), 2) AS comp_3_month_moving_avg,
LAG(mp.interest_name) OVER (ORDER BY c.month_year) AS intst_1_month_ago,
LAG(c.composition_average) OVER (ORDER BY c.month_year) AS comp_1_month_ago,
LAG(mp.interest_name, 2) OVER (ORDER BY c.month_year) AS intst_2_month_ago,
LAG(c.composition_average) OVER (ORDER BY c.month_year) AS comp_2_month_ago
FROM cte  c
JOIN interest_map  mp ON c.interest_id::INTEGER = mp.id
WHERE rk = 1
)
SELECT month_year,interest_name,composition_average AS max_index_composition,comp_3_month_moving_avg AS "3_month_moving_avg",
CONCAT(intst_1_month_ago , ' : ' , comp_1_month_ago) AS "1_month_ago",
CONCAT(intst_2_month_ago , ' : ' , comp_2_month_ago) AS "2_months_ago"
FROM cte1 WHERE month_year BETWEEN '2018-09-01' AND '2019-08-01';
```

#### 5. Provide a possible reason why the max average composition might change from month to month? Could it signal something is not quite right with the overall business model for Fresh Segments?
 
 **Seasonal changes could be the reason**
