#### 1. Which interests have been present in all month_year dates in our dataset?
```sql
WITH cte AS (
SELECT interest_id,COUNT(DISTINCT month_year) FROM interest_metrics
GROUP BY 1 HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT month_year) = ( SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT month_year) FROM interest_metrics)
)
SELECT COUNT(interest_id) AS number_of_interests
FROM cte;
```

#### 2. Using this same total_months measure - calculate the cumulative percentage of all records starting at 14 months - which total_months value passes the 90% cumulative percentage value?
 ```sql 
WITH cte AS (
SELECT interest_id,COUNT(DISTINCT month_year) AS total_months FROM interest_metrics
WHERE month_year IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1
)
,
cte1 AS (
SELECT total_months, COUNT(*) AS number_of_interests
FROM cte GROUP BY 1)
,
cum_pct AS (
SELECT * ,
ROUND((SUM(number_of_interests) OVER (ORDER BY total_months DESC ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) / SUM(number_of_interests) OVER () * 100), 1) AS cumulative_pct
FROM cte1 ORDER BY 1)

SELECT * FROM cum_pct WHERE cumulative_pct>=90;
```

#### 3. If we were to remove all interest_id values which are lower than the total_months value we found in the previous question - how many total data points would we be removing?

**6 is the threshold as observed from previous question**
```sql
WITH cte AS (
SELECT interest_id,COUNT(DISTINCT month_year) AS total_months FROM interest_metrics
WHERE month_year IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT month_year)>=6
)

SELECT COUNT(*) AS excluded_data_points  
FROM interest_metrics
WHERE interest_id NOT IN 
( SELECT DISTINCT interest_id FROM cte
);
```

#### 4. Does this decision make sense to remove these data points from a business perspective? Use an example where there are all 14 months present to a removed interest example for your arguments - think about what it means to have less months present from a segment perspective.
```sql
WITH cte AS (
SELECT interest_id,COUNT(DISTINCT month_year) AS total_months FROM interest_metrics
WHERE month_year IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT month_year)>=6
)
,
excl AS (
SELECT month_year, COUNT(*) AS excluded_data_points   
FROM interest_metrics
WHERE interest_id NOT IN 
( SELECT DISTINCT interest_id FROM cte
)
GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1)
,
incl AS (
SELECT month_year, COUNT(*) AS included_data_points   
FROM interest_metrics
WHERE interest_id IN 
( SELECT DISTINCT interest_id FROM cte
)
GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1)


SELECT incl.*,excl.excluded_data_points,
ROUND(100 * excl.excluded_data_points/(excl.excluded_data_points+incl.included_data_points)::NUMERIC,2 ) AS exclude_pct
FROM incl JOIN excl ON incl.month_year=excl.month_year;
```

**Since exclude perecent is very low for each month year removing those data point will not bring larger change to dataset and business can focus on those interest_id where customer are largely interested**

#### 5. After removing these interests - how many unique interests are there for each month?
```sql
WITH cte AS (
SELECT interest_id,COUNT(DISTINCT month_year) AS total_months FROM interest_metrics
WHERE month_year IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT month_year)>=6
)

SELECT month_year, COUNT(*) AS included_data_points   
FROM interest_metrics
WHERE interest_id IN 
( SELECT DISTINCT interest_id FROM cte
)
GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1;
```
