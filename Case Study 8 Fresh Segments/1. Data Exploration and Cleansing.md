```sql
ALTER TABLE interest_metrics
ALTER COLUMN month_year TYPE DATE
USING TO_DATE(month_year, 'MM-YYYY');

SELECT  table_name, column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns WHERE 
table_name = 'interest_metrics'
AND column_name='month_year' ;
```

#### 2. What is count of records in the fresh_segments.interest_metrics for each month_year value sorted in chronological order (earliest to latest) with the null values appearing first?
```sql
SELECT month_year,COUNT(*) AS count_of_records FROM interest_metrics
GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1 IS NULL ASC;
```

#### 3. What do you think we should do with these null values in the fresh_segments.interest_metrics
 **We should drop them** 
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM interest_metrics
WHERE month_year IS NULL;
```

```sql
SELECT *
FROM interest_metrics
WHERE month_year IS NULL;
```

#### 4. How many interest_id values exist in the fresh_segments.interest_metrics table but not in the fresh_segments.interest_map table? What about the other way around?
```sql
WITH not_in_map AS (
SELECT DISTINCT interest_id::INTEGER FROM interest_metrics 
EXCEPT
SELECT DISTINCT id FROM interest_map )
,
not_in_metrics AS (
SELECT DISTINCT id FROM interest_map
EXCEPT
SELECT DISTINCT interest_id::INTEGER FROM interest_metrics )

SELECT COUNT(mp.interest_id) AS not_in_map , COUNT(me.id) AS not_in_metrics
FROM not_in_map mp JOIN not_in_metrics me ON 1=1;
 ```

#### 5. Summarise the id values in the fresh_segments.interest_map by its total record count in this table
```sql
SELECT id,COUNT(*) AS count_per_id,COUNT(*) OVER() AS total_number_0f_id
FROM interest_map 
GROUP BY 1 ORDER  BY 1;
```

#### 6. What sort of table join should we perform for our analysis and why? Check your logic by checking the rows where interest_id = 21246 in your joined output and include all columns from fresh_segments.interest_metrics and all columns from fresh_segments.interest_map except from the id column.
```sql
SELECT * FROM interest_map WHERE id=21246;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM interest_metrics WHERE interest_id::INTEGER=21246;
```

**We should use inner join using condition that month and year IS NOT NULL . we should get 10 rows of data**

```sql
SELECT me.*,mp.interest_name,mp.interest_summary,mp.created_at,mp.last_modified
FROM interest_metrics me JOIN interest_map mp ON me.interest_id::NUMERIC=mp.id
WHERE me.interest_id ::INTEGER=21246 AND me._month IS NOT NULL AND me._year IS NOT NULL;
```

#### 7. Are there any records in your joined table where the month_year value is before the created_at value from the fresh_segments.interest_map table? Do you think these values are valid and why?
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS number_of_records
FROM interest_metrics me JOIN interest_map mp ON me.interest_id::NUMERIC=mp.id AND me.month_year<mp.created_at
WHERE  me._month IS NOT NULL AND me._year IS NOT NULL;
```

```sql
SELECT me.month_year,mp.created_at
FROM interest_metrics me JOIN interest_map mp ON me.interest_id::NUMERIC=mp.id AND me.month_year<mp.created_at
WHERE  me._month IS NOT NULL AND me._year IS NOT NULL;
```

**yes they are valid since month_year is an aggregated column for month of a particular year**
