#### The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:

- monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
- upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
- upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
- once a customer churns they will no longer make payments

##### Procedure - creating multiple temporary table first and then using recusrive cte to implement the output
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS subs_plans;
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE subs_plans AS (
SELECT s.customer_id,s.plan_id,p.plan_name,p.price,s.start_date
FROM subscriptions AS s
JOIN PLANS AS p ON p.plan_id = s.plan_id
);
```
**NOT ALL ROWS ARE DISPLAYED**

ELSE 0 END AS amount,
lead(plan_name) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY start_date) AS next_plan
FROM subs_plans
WHERE plan_id <> 0
AND start_date BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31');
