-- Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.
-- Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

-- Q1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?
-- SOLUTION -
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS 'total_customers' FROM details;


-- Q2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value
-- SOLUTION - 
SELECT MONTH(start_date) AS 'month',MONTHNAME(start_date) AS 'month_name',COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS 'monthly_dsitribution' FROM details
WHERE plan_id=0 GROUP BY 1,2 ORDER BY 1,2 ;


-- Q3. What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each plan_name
-- SOLUTION -
SELECT p.plan_name,after_2020 FROM 
(SELECT plan_name,COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS 'after_2020' FROM details
WHERE YEAR(start_date)>'2020' GROUP BY 1)c 
RIGHT JOIN plans p ON c.plan_name=p.plan_name;
 
 
-- Q4. What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?
-- SOLUTION -
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN plan_name=LOWER('churn')  THEN customer_id ELSE NULL END) AS 'churn_count',
ROUND((COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN plan_name=LOWER('churn')  THEN customer_id ELSE NULL END)/COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id))*100,1) AS 'churn_pct'
FROM details;


-- Q5. How many customers have churned straight after their initial free trial - what percentage is this rounded to the nearest whole number?
WITH cte AS (
SELECT * , DENSE_RANK()OVER(PARTITION BY  customer_id ORDER BY start_date) AS 'rk' 
FROM details)

-- Q6. What is the number and percentage of customer plans after their initial free trial?
-- SOLUTION-

-- Q7. What is the customer count and percentage breakdown of all 5 plan_name values at 2020-12-31?
-- SOLUTION -
WITH cte AS (
SELECT * ,LEAD(start_date)OVER(PARTITION BY  customer_id ORDER BY start_date) AS 'latest_plan' 
FROM details
WHERE start_date<='2020-12-31')

-- Q8. How many customers have upgraded to an annual plan in 2020?
-- SOLUTION - 
WITH cte AS (

FROM details
WHERE plan_id = 0 OR plan_id=3)

-- Q10. Can you further breakdown this average value into 30 day periods (i.e. 0-30 days, 31-60 days etc)
-- SOLUTION -
WITH cte AS (
SELECT *,DATEDIFF(LEAD(start_date)OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY start_date),start_date) AS 'days'
FROM details
WHERE plan_id = 0 OR plan_id=3)

-- Q11. How many customers downgraded from a pro monthly to a basic monthly plan in 2020?
-- SOLUTION -

--                                                      C. Challenge Payment Question
-- The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions 
-- table with the following requirements:
-- monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
-- upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
-- upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
-- once a customer churns they will no longer make payments
