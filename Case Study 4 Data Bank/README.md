<h1>Introduction</h1>

There is a new innovation in the financial industry called Neo-Banks: new aged digital only banks without physical branches.

Danny thought that there should be some sort of intersection between these new age banks, cryptocurrency and the data world…so he decides to launch a new initiative - Data Bank!

Data Bank runs just like any other digital bank - but it isn’t only for banking activities, they also have the world’s most secure distributed data storage platform!

Customers are allocated cloud data storage limits which are directly linked to how much money they have in their accounts. There are a few interesting caveats that go with this business model, and this is where the Data Bank team need your help!

The management team at Data Bank want to increase their total customer base - but also need some help tracking just how much data storage their customers will need.

This case study is all about calculating metrics, growth and helping the business analyse their data in a smart way to better forecast and plan for their future developments!

<h1>Datasets</h1>

- **regions:** Represents the global network of nodes in the Data Bank platform, serving as storage locations for both money and data, similar to bank branches or stores.

- **customer_nodes:** Contains data on the random distribution of customers across nodes based on their regions. It specifies which node holds each customer's cash and data. The random distribution changes frequently to enhance security and prevent unauthorized access.

- **customer_transactions:** Stores information about all customer activities related to their Data Bank debit card. This includes records of customer deposits, withdrawals, and purchases made using the debit card.
