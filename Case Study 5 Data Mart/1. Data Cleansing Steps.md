#### In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table in the data_mart schema named clean_weekly_sales:

- Convert the week_date to a DATE format

- Add a week_number as the second column for each week_date value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2 etc

- Add a month_number with the calendar month for each week_date value as the 3rd column

- Add a calendar_year column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values

- Add a new column called age_band after the original segment column using the following mapping on the number inside the segment value

- Add a new demographic column using the following mapping for the first letter in the segment values

- Ensure all null string values with an "unknown" string value in the original segment column as well as the new age_band and demographic columns

- Generate a new avg_transaction column as the sales value divided by transactions rounded to 2 decimal places for each record

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS weekly_sales_new;
CREATE TEMP TABLE weekly_sales_new AS (
SELECT 	TO_DATE(week_date, 'dd/mm/yy') AS week_day,	
DATE_PART('month', to_date(week_date, 'dd/mm/yy'))::int AS month_number,
DATE_PART('year', to_date(week_date, 'dd/mm/yy'))::int AS calendar_year,
region,platform,
CASE
WHEN segment IS NOT NULL OR segment <> 'null' THEN segment ELSE 'unknown' END AS segment,
CASE WHEN substring(segment, 2, 1) = '1' THEN 'Young Adults'
WHEN substring(segment, 2, 1) = '2' THEN 'Middle Aged'
WHEN substring(segment, 2, 1) = '3'
OR substring(segment, 2, 1) = '4' THEN 'Retirees' ELSE 'unknown' END AS age_band,
CASE
WHEN substring(segment, 1, 1) = 'C' THEN 'Couples'
WHEN substring(segment, 1, 1) = 'F' THEN 'Families' ELSE 'unknown' END AS demographics,
customer_type,transactions,sales,
ROUND((sales ::NUMERIC/ transactions::NUMERIC), 2) AS average_transactions
FROM weekly_sales
);
```
