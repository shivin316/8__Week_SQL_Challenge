ROUND(AVG(CASE platform WHEN 'Shopify' THEN average_transactions ELSE NULL END), 2) AS shopify_transaction_size_average
FROM weekly_sales_new
GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1;
-- NO we cannot . The correct method is given below -
SELECT calendar_year,
ROUND(AVG(CASE platform WHEN 'Retail' THEN transactions ELSE NULL END), 2) AS retail_transaction_size_average,
ROUND(AVG(CASE platform WHEN 'Shopify' THEN transactions ELSE NULL END), 2) AS shopify_transaction_size_average
FROM weekly_sales_new
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```
