--                                  2. Data Exploration

-- Q1. What day of the week is used for each week_date value?
-- SOLUTION -
SELECT 	DISTINCT EXTRACT(DOW FROM week_day)::int AS day_of_week,
	TO_CHAR(week_day, 'Day') AS day_of_week_name
 FROM weekly_sales_new;


-- Q2. What range of week numbers are missing from the dataset?
-- SOLUTION -
SELECT generate_series AS missing_weeks FROM (
SELECT * FROM GENERATE_SERIES(1,52,1) 
EXCEPT
SELECT DISTINCT EXTRACT(WEEK FROM week_day) FROM weekly_sales_new ORDER BY 1)x;


-- Q3. How many total transactions were there for each year in the dataset?
-- SOLUTION -
SELECT calendar_year,
COUNT(transactions) AS number_0f_transactions,SUM(transactions) AS total_transactions_amount
FROM weekly_sales_new GROUP BY 1;


--Q4. What is the total sales for each region for each month?
-- SOLUTION -
SELECT region,calendar_year,month_number,SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM weekly_sales_new GROUP BY 1,2,3 ORDER BY 1,2,3;


--Q5. What is the total count of transactions for each platform
-- SOLUTION -
SELECT platform,COUNT(transactions) AS number_of_transactions
FROM weeklY_sales_new GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1;


-- Q6. What is the percentage of sales for Retail vs Shopify for each month?
-- SOLUTION -
SELECT calendar_year,month_number,
ROUND((100 * retail_sales / (retail_sales + shopify_sales)::NUMERIC), 2) AS retail_sales_pct,
ROUND((100 * shopify_sales / (retail_sales + shopify_sales)::NUMERIC), 2) AS shopify_sales_pct
FROM(
SELECT calendar_year,month_number,
SUM(CASE WHEN platform='Retail' THEN sales ELSE NULL END)AS retail_sales,
SUM(CASE WHEN platform='Shopify' THEN sales ELSE NULL END) AS shopify_sales
FROM weeklY_sales_new GROUP BY 1,2 ORDER BY 1,2)x;


-- Q7. What is the percentage of sales by demographic for each year in the dataset?
-- SOLUTION -
SELECT calendar_year,
ROUND((100 * couples_sales / (couples_sales + families_sales + unknown_sales)::NUMERIC), 2) AS couples_sales_pct,
ROUND((100 * families_sales / (couples_sales + families_sales + unknown_sales)::NUMERIC), 2) AS families_sales_pct,
ROUND((100 * unknown_sales / (couples_sales + families_sales + unknown_sales)::NUMERIC), 2) AS retail_sales_pct
FROM (
SELECT calendar_year,
SUM(CASE WHEN LOWER(demographics)='couples' THEN sales ELSE NULL END) AS couples_sales,
SUM(CASE WHEN LOWER(demographics)='families' THEN sales ELSE NULL END) AS families_sales,
SUM(CASE WHEN LOWER(demographics)='unknown' THEN sales ELSE NULL END) AS unknown_sales
FROM weekly_sales_new GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1)x;


-- Q8.Which age_band and demographic values contribute the most to Retail sales?
-- SOLUTION - 
SELECT age_band,demographics,total_sales
FROM
(SELECT age_band,demographics,SUM(sales) AS total_sales,DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY SUM(sales) DESC) AS rk
FROM weekly_sales_new
WHERE LOWER(platform)='retail'
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 3 DESC)x WHERE rk=1;


-- Q9. Can we use the avg_transaction column to find the average transaction size for each year for Retail vs Shopify? If not - how would you calculate it instead?
-- SOLUTION 
SELECT calendar_year,
ROUND(AVG(CASE platform WHEN 'Retail' THEN average_transactions ELSE NULL END), 2) AS retail_transaction_size_average,
ROUND(AVG(CASE platform WHEN 'Shopify' THEN average_transactions ELSE NULL END), 2) AS shopify_transaction_size_average
FROM weekly_sales_new
GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1;
-- NO we cannot . The correct method is given below -
SELECT calendar_year,
ROUND(AVG(CASE platform WHEN 'Retail' THEN transactions ELSE NULL END), 2) AS retail_transaction_size_average,
ROUND(AVG(CASE platform WHEN 'Shopify' THEN transactions ELSE NULL END), 2) AS shopify_transaction_size_average
FROM weekly_sales_new
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;

--                                   3. Before & After Analysis

-- Taking the week_date value of 2020-06-15 as the baseline week where the Data Mart sustainable packaging changes came into effect.
-- We would include all week_date values for 2020-06-15 as the start of the period after the change and the previous week_date values would be before
-- Using this analysis approach - answer the following questions:
-- Q1 What is the total sales for the 4 weeks before and after 2020-06-15? What is the growth or reduction rate in actual values and percentage of sales?
-- SOLUTION -
