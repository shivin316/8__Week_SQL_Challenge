#### Taking the week_date value of 2020-06-15 as the baseline week where the Data Mart sustainable packaging changes came into effect.We would include all week_date values for 2020-06-15 as the start of the period after the change and the previous week_date values would be before . Using this analysis approach - answer the following questions:

#### 1. What is the total sales for the 4 weeks before and after 2020-06-15? What is the growth or reduction rate in actual values and percentage of sales?
```sql
WITH four_week_before AS (
SELECT '2020-06-15' AS base_week,SUM(sales) AS sales_four_week_before
FROM weekly_sales_new
WHERE
week_day BETWEEN TO_CHAR(('2020-06-15'::DATE - INTERVAL '4 week'), 'YYYY-MM-DD')::DATE AND '2020-06-15'::DATE
),
four_week_after AS (
SELECT '2020-06-15' AS base_week,SUM(sales) AS sales_four_week_after
FROM weekly_sales_new
WHERE
week_day BETWEEN '2020-06-15'::DATE AND TO_CHAR(('2020-06-15'::DATE + INTERVAL '4 week'), 'YYYY-MM-DD')::DATE
)


SELECT b.sales_four_week_before,a.sales_four_week_after,
a.sales_four_week_after-b.sales_four_week_before AS change_in_sales,
ROUND(100*(a.sales_four_week_after-b.sales_four_week_before)/(b.sales_four_week_before ::NUMERIC),2) AS pct_change
FROM four_week_before b JOIN four_week_after a ON b.base_week=a.base_week;
```

#### 2. What about the entire 12 weeks before and after?
```sql
WITH twelve_week_before AS (
SELECT '2020-06-15' AS base_week,SUM(sales) AS sales_twelve_week_before
FROM weekly_sales_new
WHERE
week_day BETWEEN TO_CHAR(('2020-06-15'::DATE - INTERVAL '12 week'), 'YYYY-MM-DD')::DATE AND '2020-06-15'::DATE
),
twelve_week_after AS (
SELECT '2020-06-15' AS base_week,SUM(sales) AS sales_twelve_week_after
FROM weekly_sales_new
WHERE
week_day BETWEEN '2020-06-15'::DATE AND TO_CHAR(('2020-06-15'::DATE + INTERVAL '12 week'), 'YYYY-MM-DD')::DATE
)


SELECT b.sales_twelve_week_before,a.sales_twelve_week_after,
a.sales_twelve_week_after-b.sales_twelve_week_before AS change_in_sales,
ROUND(100*(a.sales_twelve_week_after-b.sales_twelve_week_before)/(b.sales_twelve_week_before ::NUMERIC),2) AS pct_change
FROM twelve_week_before b JOIN twelve_week_after a ON b.base_week=a.base_week;
```

#### 3. How do the sale metrics for these 2 periods before and after compare with the previous years in 2018 and 2019?
```sql
WITH four_week_before_2020 AS (
SELECT '2020-06-15' AS base_week,SUM(sales) AS sales_four_week_before
FROM weekly_sales_new
WHERE
week_day BETWEEN TO_CHAR(('2020-06-15'::DATE - INTERVAL '4 week'), 'YYYY-MM-DD')::DATE AND '2020-06-15'::DATE

),
four_week_after_2018 AS (
SELECT '2018-06-15' AS base_week,SUM(sales) AS sales_four_week_after

WHERE
week_day BETWEEN '2018-06-15'::DATE AND TO_CHAR(('2018-06-15'::DATE + INTERVAL '4 week'), 'YYYY-MM-DD')::DATE
)

SELECT 2020 AS Year, b.sales_four_week_before,a.sales_four_week_after,
a.sales_four_week_after-b.sales_four_week_before AS change_in_sales,
